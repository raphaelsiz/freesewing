title: "Bookmarks: Type"
---

Every bookmark has a **type** attribute that is mandatory.

When you manually create a bookmark, the type is always **custom** so you cannot choose it.

Other types include **pattern** or **docs** which will automatically be set when you bookmark a pattern or documentation page respectively.
